# Verilog Mini Projects Repository

*Beginner to Intermediate Digital Design with Verilog â€” Hands-on RTL practice for VLSI & semiconductor careers*

---

## ðŸš€ About This Repository

Welcome! Iâ€™m Sindhu Yesilanka, an aspiring VLSI engineer passionate about digital design and hardware development. This repository contains a curated set of Verilog mini-projects Iâ€™ve built to strengthen my RTL coding skills and prepare for semiconductor internships and interviews.

Each project includes:

- Clean, well-commented Verilog source code  
- Testbenches for thorough verification  
- Design explanations and modeling styles (gate-level, dataflow, behavioral, structural)  
- Waveform screenshots (where applicable)  
- Easy instructions to simulate on [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/) or your preferred tool

These projects cover foundational combinational and sequential circuits, arithmetic units, FSMs, and more â€” perfect for beginners and intermediate learners aiming to build a solid digital design portfolio.
