# Verilog-mini-projects
Beginner to intermediate Verilog projects including combinational and sequential circuits, ALU design, and FSM implementations. Built for hands-on RTL design learning and VLSI role preparation.
# Verilog Mini Projects âš™

This repository contains a series of Verilog mini-projects Iâ€™ve been building to improve my digital design and RTL coding skills. Itâ€™s focused on foundational designs important for VLSI and semiconductor roles.

## ðŸš€ What's Inside

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Full Adder | Gate-level, dataflow, and structural models |
| 4:1 Multiplexer | Selects input lines based on select bits |
| 3:8 Decoder | Converts 3-bit input to 8 outputs |
| 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder | Adds two 4-bit numbers with carry chaining |
| D Flip-Flop | Sequential element with clock edge triggering |
| FSM - Vending Machine | Finite state machine for coin-based input system |

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Build a strong foundation in Verilog for VLSI jobs
- Practice testbenches and waveform debugging
- Prepare for internships, interviews, and research work

## ðŸ”— Tools Used

- EDA Playground (online Verilog simulator)
  
## ðŸ“Œ How to Run

Each folder contains:
- Main Verilog code (`.v`)
- Testbench file (`tb_*.v`)
- Optional waveform screenshots

You can copy-paste the code into [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/) to simulate.
